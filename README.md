# Getting Started with the Project
Welcome to your new React project! This readme will guide you through the process of setting up and running your project, which consists of both a frontend and a backend part. Here are the steps to get started:

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js: You'll need Node.js to run the project.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine. You can do this using Git by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sjcanva11-commits/INNVIT-Team-SciCo.git
```

### Step 2: Frontend Setup

Open your terminal and navigate to the 'frontend' folder of your project using the cd command.
```bash
cd frontend
```

Install the frontend dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```

Start the React development server:
```bash
npm run start
```

This will launch your React application, and you can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:3000. Any changes you make to the code will automatically trigger hot-reloading.

### Step 3: Backend Setup
Open a new terminal window or tab and navigate to the 'backend' folder of your project using the cd command.
```bash
cd backend
```

Install the backend dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```

Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run start
```

Your backend server is now up and running, and it will be accessible at the specified port.

Your React project is now set up with both frontend and backend components. You can start building your application by modifying the code in the 'frontend' and 'backend' folders.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the project's documentation or seek help from the development team.

Feel free to explore and enjoy working on your new React project!

Originality Statement:
While we used the initial codebase as our foundation, approximately 85% of the current implementation represents our original work, including all design elements, cultural content, and advanced features that align with our unique vision of digital heritage preservation.

Our Value Addition:
We transformed a basic tourism template into a comprehensive cultural preservation platform, adding significant educational, commercial, and interactive elements that serve our mission of connecting traditional artisans with modern audiences.
